This was an assignment which assessed the implementation of a shortest path traversal (assuming equal distance between nodes) and binary search tree. Also implemented a Junit test class to test the Depth First Search.

Shortest Path:
Context was based on visiting towns â€“ Required to deliver methods that would allow a user to enter towns and add edges between towns. User would then be able to call a method to print the distance (in nodes/towns) and the towns visited on the shortest path. This can be implemented (and is pre-configured with an example) in the TownsClient class. Diagram to represent the example case is also uploaded.

Binary Search Tree:
Context was based on a student registry. Users were required to be able to add students (represented as Student objects) to the search tree, then use a method to find the oldest student. Accessible via the StudentClient class (has pre-configured example).

Library dependencies also uploaded (Junit and Hamcrest).
